Hey, it's Rudy!

See this file? You've pulled the project from Github! Congrats!!

Whenever you work on the project from your own device, you'll have to Commit your changes, and Push their origin back to Github.

Don't forget or else we won't be able to see your work!

- Remember to stay organized when working with files. Don't rename folders and such often, it'll mess with other people's devices!
- If you feel like you've broken something, talk with the group before uploading your own project files. 
- Detail your Commits simply, but let others know exactly what you've accomplished!
- Feel free to use this "Files" folder to keep misc information for work. Things like our Game Concept Document can go in here.

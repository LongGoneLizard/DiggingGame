  FlavorText: Constructing the Golden Shovel was originally thought to be a massive
    waste of gold. This was, of course, before the animals saw it used to tear through
    The Valley at blinding speeds. Eventually, it was locked away in a hidden shrine,
    never to be wielded again. That's just a story, though. Of course it doesn't
    really exist!

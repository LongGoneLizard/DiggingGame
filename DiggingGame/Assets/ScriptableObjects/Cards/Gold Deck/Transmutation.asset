  FlavorText: The process of transmutation is a particular one, capable of turning
    stone into the purest quality of gold. This is very difficult however, and I've
    never seen it performed correctly. Most of the time, I just watch a perfectly
    good stone dissolve into nothing. It's always a bit sad to see.

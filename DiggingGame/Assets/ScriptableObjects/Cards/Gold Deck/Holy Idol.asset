  FlavorText: The Holy Idol is a legendary artifact created centuries ago to praise
    the deities of The Valley. Nothing more is recorded about these deities or the
    Idol besides its mere existence. It's said that any animal in possession of it
    would have full control over every resource.
  MoleQuote: '"Did you ever want to ask The Valley''s creators anything? Like, why
    was The Valley made in the first place?"'
  MeerkatQuote: '"Yeah... Of course I have. Maybe with the Idol you could, but good
    luck finding that."'

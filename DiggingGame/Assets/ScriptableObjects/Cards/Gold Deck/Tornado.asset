  FlavorText: A tornado is said to be The Valley's unbridled rage condensed into
    a single whirling force of destruction, capable of wiping out entire populations.
    I've only heard stories of tornadoes during my time here. It makes vines, floods,
    and even quakes seem like minor disruptions.

  FlavorText: 'It''s commonplace for animals to fight, but sometimes, things go too
    far. The loss of a structure is rarely seen to throw the animals into a deep,
    fierce rage. The Valley itself reacts to this anger, exhibiting a similar response
    that could stunt a civilization''s resources permanently. '

  FlavorText: The metal detector is a prime example of science and magic working
    hand in hand - this incredible device is capable of revealing the true properties
    of any stone it scans. Legends describe old metal detectors being used to discover
    gold in its purest form - still nestled in the ground of The Valley.

    it later, alright?"'
  MeerkatQuote: '"Yeah, later. Sure."'

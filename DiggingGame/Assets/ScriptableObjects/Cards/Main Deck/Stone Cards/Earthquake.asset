  FlavorText: I was calmly sketching a nearby mine, until suddenly, I felt like I
    was a coin rattling in a tip jar. I quickly realized that it wasn't me who was
    shaking, but instead, it was everything around me. I ran before it got too dangerous,
    leaving the sound of crumbling structures behind me. I hope everyone's alright!

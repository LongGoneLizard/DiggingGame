  FlavorText: I didn't believe in luck until yesterday. A terrible wave of water
    covered nearly half of The Valley - I heard many burrows were destroyed. I got
    completely drenched, but somehow my notebook stayed dry. Floods here have a long
    history of ruining tunnels, tools, and similar things.
